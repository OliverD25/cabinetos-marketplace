# Notices: the theme collection

Every theme in this folder is a port of someone else's colour theme. The
port itself (the mapping of a palette to CabinetOS's keys, and each JSON
file) is CabinetOS's work under the project's [MIT License](LICENSE).
The colours come from the sources below, each under the license named
there. Each theme file repeats its source and license in `attribution`.

How the sources were read: on 2026-09-29, from each project's public
repository at the commit named below (a raw file at a fixed commit), and
from the npm package named for GitHub's colours. Each license file was read
at the same commit and checked to be the MIT License text; gruvbox has no
license file, and Shades of Purple adds one condition, as their rows say.
No value was written from memory, so nothing here is marked "to verify".

## What the port derives

The source colours are used as they are. What the port adds:

- **Alpha.** The layer, control, Acrylic and terminal-panel colours are
  source colours with the alpha the shipped themes use (for example
  `layerFill` at `80`). The Mica tint is the darkest of the source's
  editor, side bar and panel backgrounds, at opacity 0.9. The Catppuccin
  flavours map each palette role the way the shipped Catppuccin Mocha does.
- **`folderIconFront`** is the folder colour moved 35 % toward white, as in
  the shipped themes; Panda and Horizon Dark use the lighter shade their
  source has.
- **Text colours for contrast.** Where a theme's own text colour falls
  below 4.5:1 as the window draws it, the port uses another of the theme's
  text colours, the theme's main text at a lower alpha, or, where the
  theme has nothing brighter (darker, for a light theme), its main text
  moved toward white (black) by the least amount that reaches 4.5:1. Each
  case is listed in [README.md](README.md), "Contrast".
- **Terminal colours.** Atom One Light, the Darcula port, Material Theme
  and Sublime Material define no terminal colours; theirs are built from
  the theme's own syntax colours. Where SynthWave '84 and Horizon leave an
  ANSI colour unset, it is Visual Studio Code's default. Horizon Bright's
  cursor is its editor cursor colour, because its terminal cursor colour
  (`#F9CEC3B3`) cannot be seen on its background; Shades of Purple's red
  (`#EC3A37F5`) is used without its alpha.

## Not used, and why

- **Monokai Pro** is a commercial product: the classic Monokai that
  Visual Studio Code ships under the MIT License is used instead (file
  `monokai`), and its description says so.
- **JetBrains' own Darcula files** are not used; the colours are the MIT
  community port's, as its description says.
- **The Material Theme for Visual Studio Code**
  (`material-theme/vsc-material-theme`) now redirects to
  `vira-soft/vira-assets`, the assets of its commercial successor, with no
  license: Mattia Astorino's MIT Material Theme for Sublime Text is used.
- **The Panda theme for Visual Studio Code**
  (`tinkertrain/panda-syntax-vscode`) states no license: the same author's
  MIT Atom and Hyper themes are used.
- **City Lights** (Yummygum, `Yummygum/city-lights-syntax-vsc` 1.1.9 at
  `e9e299e981c95c953750d5029b4ec94248071a1c`) is licensed under Creative
  Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0: a port is a
  derivative work, which that license forbids. Left out.
- **Dainty** (Alexander Teinum) is MIT (the fork `HotWordland/dainty-vscode`
  1.1.22 at `237f5d5ac2c4610818576805e407c2bbbae1da74` keeps the author's
  license), but its colours are generated at build time by the
  `dainty-shared` package, whose repository and package are no longer
  published, and no public file holds the generated colours. Left out
  rather than written from memory.
- **Nord** and **Catppuccin Mocha** ship with the core; the collection does
  not repeat them.
